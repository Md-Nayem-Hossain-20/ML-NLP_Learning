Real-world Example: Multithreading for I/O-bound Tasks.
Scenario: Web Scrapping
Web Scrapping often involves making numerous network requests to fetch web pages. These task are I/O-bound because they spend a lot of time waiting for responses from servers. Multithreading can significantly improve the performance by allowing multiple web pages to be fetched concurrently.
